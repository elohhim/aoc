# Advent of Code solutions in Java (maybe other JVM languages in the future)

Uses [picocli](https://picocli.info/) for creating CLI interface and [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) as the build tool.

## Usage

Using Gradle

```
./gradlew run --args="solve [YEAR] [DAY]"
```

## Exercises

- Trying how different Java DI frameworks play together with JSR-330 annotations.
- Sprinkled with [Vavr](https://www.vavr.io/) here and there

## Constraints

- None yet

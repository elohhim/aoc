# AOC Viewer

Simple web app for exploring my AOC solutions.

## Motivation

In my job, I just finished a project about including some `.md` files in one of
our internal dev tools. As I was looking for some idea for a side project,
I decided that I could try and reuse what I've learned. Hence this project.
Well, it is not exactly about including markdown files but rather source files
(in different languages). But the overall principle should be similar. I hope
this explains (even if just a little) the technology choice (Angular) that
usually would not be the first that comes into mind for such use case.

## Tech stack

Angular (so far).

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
